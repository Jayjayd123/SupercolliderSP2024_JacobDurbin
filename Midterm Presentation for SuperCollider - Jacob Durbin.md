### Midterm Presentation for SuperCollider - Jacob Durbin

For my presentation I studied the work "Chemical" by Artist "Qirky" or Ryan Kirkbride

### About:

"Chemical" is a piece written in SuperCollider and is 33 minutes long. It consists of Ryan's pre-built Instrument definitions which he then arranges in real time in the youtube video. The video is at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTJXrJWtUBg

Ryan has performed at many Algorave events and is developing a coding environment called FoxDot.

I learned all of this info through his github page as well as various youtube videos. At the time of writting this documentation file, I've left a comment on a few vids and I'm awaiting a reply. If I hear anything, I'll update this file!

I really enjoyed this piece and it was fairly easy to analyze because it had so many cool things to offer! One particular thing about the piece I really enjoyed was the panning. The use of panning between all the many instruments was very tactile to the ears and pleasent to listen to!

I had fun with this presentation and I can't wait to share it!
