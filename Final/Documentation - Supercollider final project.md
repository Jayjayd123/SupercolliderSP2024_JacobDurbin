### Supercollider final project - Jacob durbin


For my supercollider final project, I created a chill ambient sort of track that is easy to run so that my partner will not have issues running it. 

I ran into a lot of syntax errors and just random things because I forgot a semi-colon here and there but all in all, it was fairly smooth sailing. My piece is about 4-5 minutes long depending on how you run it. Could even be hours if you wanted. I spent a lot of time exploring and creatively borrowing code to interpret myself and create the vibe. 


I found this "SuperCollider Code" website that was super cool and helpful and here's a page where I borrowed a synthdef and adjusted the parameters: https://sccode.org/1-5hW

I also referenced Rachael's codealongs quite often, being the "Effects" and "Synthesis" modules. I used some of the time syncing stuff so I could play to a tempo and cue things on the next bar. Very akin to Ableton's clip stuff.

I learned a lot throughout this project and I can't wait to see what jose does with it. We've been talking and I showed him how to play my track. He's currently super booked right now with a gig tonight as I write this so he got an extension on the project. He's killing it!


Super glad I got to work on this project and here's to more supercollider in the future!
